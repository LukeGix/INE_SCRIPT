- Infostealer.cpp
- Brute.py


## Infostealer.cpp

Task 1: Create a simple program that steals user's directory content.
Using C++, write a program that checks what files and directories are stored in the target's directory, and also sends their name back to the penetration tester.

## Brute.py

Task 2: Develop a brute-forcing script in Python, that will use employee details as credentials
It is not uncommon to come across an employee's name being used as a username. It is also not uncommon to see an employee's department being used as a password. Corporate sites usually include these pieces of information.

Collecting such information by hand, can be a tedious procedure. So, use Python to collect them (scrape them) and also create a brute-forcing script that will use the collected information as credentials. Use the brute-forcing script against the Admin Area.
